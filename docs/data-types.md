# Data Types

There are two "types" of arguments, primitive types, such as `string`,
`number`, and `boolean`, and custom types, such as `range`. Use primitive
types as you would in any programming languages--i.e., `string` variables
are surrounded by single or double quotes, and numbers and booleans should not
be surrounded by quotes.

Custom types, on the other hand, are usually a combination of primite types
and must follow a specific format. These custom types and their formats
are defined in the sections below.
